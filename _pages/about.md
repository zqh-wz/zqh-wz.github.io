I am currently a second year Ph.D. student in <a href='https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>PACMAN Lab</a>, advised by <a href='https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjd/'>Prof. Jidong Zhai</a>. I received my BSc in Computer Science and Technology in 2023 from Tsinghua University.

My research interests include high performance computing, compilers and machine learning systems. Currently, I am focused on large language model inference systems.
